# SystemC

Some interesting SystemC Projects:
----------------------------------

To build:
1) The autogenerated (from Eclipse) makefiles are in the Debug directory.
2) For building the ALU you need to install Systemc 2.3.1 libraries
3) For buliding the AtoDConv you need to install the Systemc 2.3.1 and Systemc AMS 2.0

You can download both from http://accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc
